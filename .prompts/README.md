# Prompts Directory

This directory contains prompt files and guidelines for AI-assisted development of axiOS.

## Files

- **MASTER_PROMPT.md** - Primary reference document with constraints, lessons learned, and development guidelines
- (Future prompt files can be added here)

## Purpose

These prompts help ensure consistency and quality when working with AI assistants on this repository by:

1. **Documenting lessons learned** from past sessions
2. **Establishing clear constraints** for how to approach changes
3. **Preventing repeated mistakes** that have costly iteration cycles
4. **Maintaining repository conventions** across sessions
5. **Providing context** for new sessions

## Usage

**For AI Assistants:**
- Read MASTER_PROMPT.md at the start of any session
- Follow the constraints and patterns documented
- Reference specific sections when making changes in those areas
- Update the document when new lessons are learned

**For Developers:**
- Review before major changes to understand conventions
- Update when discovering new patterns or pitfalls
- Add specific prompts for complex subsystems as needed

## Guidelines for Prompt Files

When adding new prompt files to this directory:

- Use descriptive names (e.g., `NIX_TYPES.md`, `INSTALLER_PATTERNS.md`)
- Include concrete examples of correct and incorrect patterns
- Document "why" not just "what"
- Keep focused on actionable constraints
- Update MASTER_PROMPT.md if adding general lessons

## Maintenance

This directory should be updated:
- After discovering costly mistakes (see session 2025-10-20)
- When establishing new conventions
- After major architectural changes
- When patterns emerge from multiple sessions
