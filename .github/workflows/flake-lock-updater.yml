            Automated flake.lock update
            
            ## ✅ Automated Validation Results
            - ✅ Flake check passed on all systems
            - ✅ Basic build tests passed (formatter, devShell)
            
            ## ⚠️ Manual Testing Required
            **Important:** CI only validates basic builds. You MUST test with a real
            configuration before merging to catch dependency conflicts like:
            - Package version mismatches
            - Missing dependencies
            - Upstream breakage
            
            ## Testing Procedure
            ```bash
            # 1. Checkout this PR
            gh pr checkout ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
            
            # 2. Run the validation script
            ./scripts/test-pr.sh
            
            # 3. Review the results
            # If tests pass → merge
            # If tests fail → close PR and investigate
            ```
            
            ## What Changed
            Review the flake.lock diff to see which inputs were updated.
            Pay special attention to:
            - Major version bumps in nixpkgs
            - Updates to critical packages (niri, home-manager, etc.)
            - Large numbers of input changes
            
            ## If Build Fails
            - Check upstream GitHub issues for affected packages
            - Wait for fixes before merging
            - Test again with `./scripts/test-pr.sh`
