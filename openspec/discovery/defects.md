# Defect Tracker

## Purpose

Lightweight tracking of discovered defects. This log serves as:
- Historical context for future proposals
- Reference when investigating related issues
- Input for prioritizing fix work

Defects here don't require immediate action. When a fix is planned, create a proposal in `openspec/changes/` and reference the defect ID.

## Status Legend

- **open** - Reported, not yet addressed
- **investigating** - Root cause being determined
- **proposal** - Fix planned in `openspec/changes/`
- **resolved** - Fixed and verified
- **wontfix** - Decided not to fix (with rationale)
- **upstream** - Issue in external dependency, not axiOS
