# Code of Ethics

This project is guided by principles of Christian virtue and mutual respect. We seek to create a community where contributors treat one another with dignity, patience, and understanding.

## Our Foundation

We are called to:

- **Love and Respect**: Treat all contributors with genuine care and respect, recognizing the inherent dignity in each person
- **Humility**: Approach discussions with openness, acknowledging that we do not have all answers
- **Patience**: Bear with one another in disagreements, seeking understanding before judgment
- **Truthfulness**: Communicate honestly and directly, while always being charitable
- **Service**: Prioritize helping others succeed over personal recognition

## In Practice

### When Contributing

- Offer your knowledge and skills freely to help others
- Share credit generously and acknowledge the work of others
- Approach code review with gentleness and encouragement
- Seek to build up rather than tear down
- Remember that behind every contribution is a person worthy of respect

### When Disagreeing

- Assume good intent in others
- Listen to understand, not merely to respond
- Speak the truth in love, with kindness and respect
- Be quick to forgive and slow to take offense
- Focus on ideas and solutions, not personalities

### When Leading

- Lead by example, demonstrating the behavior we wish to see
- Be accessible and approachable to all
- Give freely of your time and knowledge
- Correct errors with gentleness
- Celebrate the successes of others

### When Learning

- Ask questions with humility
- Express gratitude for help received
- Be patient with yourself and others in the learning process
- Share what you learn to help those who come after

## What We Reject

We do not tolerate:

- Malicious intent to harm others or the project
- Persistent dishonesty or deception
- Deliberate attempts to sow discord or division
- Actions that show contempt for human dignity
- Behavior that makes others feel unsafe or unwelcome

## Accountability

If you witness or experience behavior that violates these principles:

1. When possible, address the issue directly with the person involved, assuming good intent
2. If direct resolution is not possible or appropriate, contact the maintainers
3. All concerns will be treated seriously and with discretion

We are all imperfect and capable of mistakes. The goal is not perfection, but a genuine commitment to treating one another with the respect and dignity we all deserve.

## The Spirit of This Code

This Code of Ethics is rooted in timeless principles of virtue:

- Do to others as you would have them do to you
- Bear with one another in love
- Be kind and compassionate to one another
- Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart
- Let your words be gracious, seasoned with wisdom

We invite all who contribute to this project to embrace these principles, not as rigid rules, but as a guide to building a community characterized by mutual respect, patience, and genuine care for one another.

*"Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs."* - 1 Corinthians 13:4-5

## Inspiration

This Code of Ethics draws inspiration from the [55 Maxims of Christian Living](https://stjohnthebaptistberkeley.org/ewExternalFiles/55%20Maxims%20of%20Christian%20Living.pdf), which represent how the maintainer personally strives to live. These ancient principles of virtue, humility, and love provide a timeless foundation for human interaction and community building.
